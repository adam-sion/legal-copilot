RAG:

RETRIEVAL -> relates to  process of retrieving input related data from vector db.
AUGMENTED-> relates to model's knowledge that is augmented by retrieved data (context).
GENERATION-> related to NL model that utilizes both input and retrieved context to provide a factual final answer. 


When loading context model is unaware of there are two main approaches:

- we can either use qaAdvisor that performs a similarity search over 
vector db, then appends result to prompt 
(we can also tune qaAdvisor promptTemplate ),
then use chatClient Builder with .prompt() and .advisors()
 
- or work with plain objects: load relevant data from vector db using vectorStore.similaritySearch, then put result as context of system message. then just chatClient.call(prompt);
